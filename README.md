### This are C# scripts developed with AI to implement feedback mechanisms

- [Powder Bottle Effect](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/powdereffect.cs) - script that triggers powder emission and sound from the fertilizer bottle when it is tilted beyond a specified angle (with adjustable threshold).
- [Watercan Effect](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/watereffect.cs) - Script that triggers water emission and sound from the watering can when it is tilted beyond a specified angle (with adjustable threshold).


### This are C# scripts develop with AI to built the task trigger-responses 
- [Initial Audio](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/audioinicial.cs) - Script that triggers the inicial audio after a few seconds of the participants entering Bloomlink
- [Soil disabled ](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/showhidecoversoil.cs) - Script to hide the soil (triggered during Action B) and to initiate the audio cue for Action A of the Seed Cultivation task 
- [Place seed in soil](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/plantseed1.cs) - Script to trigger the audio cue for Action B when the seed is placed in the pot.
- [Cover seed with soil](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/shoveltrigger.cs) - Script to reveal the soil that covers the seed and trigger the audio cue for Action C when the hidden collider inside the shovel makes contact with the seed or the pot. 
- [Water soil](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/watertrigger.cs) - Script to darken the soilâ€™s color and trigger the audio cue for Action D when the hidden collider inside the watering can makes contact with the soil.
- [Fertilize soil ](https://github.com/mloc-a/BloomLink1/blob/main/plantgrow.cs) - Script to make the plant emerge and play the final audio cue of the task when the hidden collider inside the fertilizer bottle touches the soil.
